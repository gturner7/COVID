# COVID

This repository contains two visualization tools for COVID-19 datasets. 

/Python contains a jupyter notebook utilizing interactive displays and iterative algorithms.

/Tableau contains several dashboards displaying a multi-facetted view of the pandemic across the US.

Due to data source discontinuation, neither project is actively updating.
