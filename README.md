# COVID

This repository contains two visualization tools for COVID-19 datasets. 

First, there is a jupyter notebook utilizing interactive displays and iterative algorithms

Second, a tableau file contains several dashboards displaying a multi-facetted view of the pandemic across the US

due to data source discontinuation, neither project is actively updating
